# Given an object/dictionary with keys and values that consist of both strings and integers, design an algorithm to calculate and return the sum of all of the numeric values.
# For example, given the following object/dictionary as input:
# You may use whatever programming language youâ€™d like.
# Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code.
# Utilize UPER while going through thought process.
